          It was the first day of our winter holiday. All of us were veryhappy.
    Why? Because we have one months to do things we love to do. We
    are free. Although we have some homework.But we can finish them in 
    several days. And the rest time we can make good use of. My god! We 
    have been very tired after hard studying.In winter holidays, I want 
    to have full sleep and eat good food in order to replenish myself.
    Last but not the least, I will have a good rest.

    It was the second day of our winter holiday.I felt good.I felt I'm free. 
    I had a lot of time to do things I like. My parents are in Beijing. So I 
    live alone but I don¡¯t feel lonely. But I didn¡¯t do something special. 
    I stayed at home and watched TV. Oh! I wrote an English daily composition. 
    It was my homework. Today, I have slept for 14 hours. I thought I was 
    very tired. It was time for dinner. I must go! I am very hungry.

    It was the third day of our winter holiday. Today, there are many business
    in my mothers company. So my mother told me to help my uncle who is the 
    manager of my mother's company. I sat in my mother¡¯s office and help her
    answer the telephone.While I was free,I was writing my homework.Although
    I also have a lot of time to do my homework, I still do it. Because in my 
    mother¡¯s office, I had nothing to do. If I did nothing, I was wasting my 
    time and my life. I can¡¯t do the foolish thing. We should take good use of 
    our time.

    It is a special day today. My mother sent one hundred basket of red 
    bayberries. I like to eat red bayberries. It tastes nice. When they arrived
    in Shanghai,they were still fresh. But most of them would be sent to my 
    mother¡¯s business friends. I chose the best basket of red bayberries to eat. 
    I put the rest in my refrigerator. Red bayberry is my hometown¡¯s special 
    product. It is well-known in china. Many people like to eat it.

    Today, I still went to my mother¡¯s office. My mother was very busy, so was
    my father. They always live in Beijing. They must get up early. Because they
    will manage the factory. So I know they are very laborious. So I should save 
    my money. Also I should help them.Although I can¡¯t do something useful, but
    I think I should share the work with them. I am one of my family member. In 
    the future, I will take a job and work. It¡¯ time for me to begin to learn
    how to work.
